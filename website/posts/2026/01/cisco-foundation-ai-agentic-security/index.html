        <ul>
          <li><strong>What Cisco is announcing:</strong> a coordinated “agentic security systems” direction under <strong>Cisco Foundation AI</strong> (models + retrieval + multi-agent workflows), aimed at security operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Core building block:</strong> <strong>Foundation-sec-8B-Reasoning</strong>, positioned as an open-weight security reasoning model for tasks like threat modeling, attack-path analysis, and incident investigation.</li>
          <li><strong>Key claim:</strong> security teams need agentic systems that do <em>multi-step</em> reasoning over logs, configs, intel, and org context — not just one-shot Q&amp;A.</li>
          <li><strong>Retrieval layer:</strong> an “AI search” framework that iteratively refines search (reflection, backtracking, query revision) so smaller models can navigate messy information spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Operational productization:</strong> <strong>PEAK Threat Hunting Assistant</strong> applies this to threat-hunt preparation: gather intel, refine hypotheses, identify data sources, output structured hunt plans.</li>
          <li><strong>Governance emphasis:</strong> Cisco repeatedly stresses <strong>human oversight</strong>, explainability (reasoning traces), and user-controlled data access — i.e., “agents that assist” rather than fully autonomous responders.</li>
          <li><strong>Trend signal:</strong> vendors are converging on a stack: reasoning model + retrieval + agent orchestration + guardrails, with security workflows as a “killer app.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Security teams are buying time:</strong> if agentic systems can automate the “research and framing” phases (triage, hunt prep), humans can spend more time validating and responding.</li>
          <li><strong>Retrieval is the battleground:</strong> the moment you let an agent iteratively search + summarize, you’re also creating new risks (poisoned sources, prompt injection, data leakage). The architecture you pick matters.</li>
          <li><strong>Open-weight security models:</strong> if credible, they can enable on-prem / controlled deployments for regulated environments that can’t ship logs to generic LLM APIs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to do</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Decide where “agentic” is acceptable:</strong> start with low-blast-radius steps (research, hypothesis generation, draft hunt queries) before letting agents take actions in production.</li>
          <li><strong>Demand evidence trails:</strong> require citations / links for summaries, store retrieval traces, and make it easy for an analyst to reproduce why a conclusion was reached.</li>
          <li><strong>Harden your retrieval inputs:</strong> maintain curated intel sources, add allowlists, and isolate browsing/scraping from privileged environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Build an eval loop:</strong> measure false positives/negatives on real incidents and hunts; don’t rely on “looks smart” demos.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan for policy enforcement:</strong> even in “assistive” mode, implement role-based access, redaction, and output constraints (what can and can’t be summarized or exported).</li>
        </ol>
